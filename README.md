# **42**
[42 Madrid](https://www.42madrid.com) is a disruptive and innovative project which started
in Paris, France. It enforces the commitment and learning of a community of students. These
students learn thanks to the Peer to Peer -P2P- methodology and self learning. Their knowledge
is acquired through projects which are distributed in a gamified way.

Knowing this, the 2nd of August of 2021 I started my education at 42 Madrid:

After being succesful at this phase, I had the opportunity to start the cursus and being a
full 42 student. As a consequence, the 13th of September of 2021 I did the kick-off and
began the 42 cursus:
