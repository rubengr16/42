## Docker commands

In some systems the docker daemon starts automatically. To start it manually use: ```sudo systemctl start docker```

| Command | Action |
| -- | -- |
| ```docker build [{-f \| --file} <name>.Dockerfile] <path_context>``` | Build image from Dockerfile |
| ```docker image ls``` | List images |
| ```docker inspect <id>``` | Inspect image |
| ```docker history``` | See run history |

## Dockerfile

Docker builds images by reading the instructions from a ```Dockerfile```. A ```Dockerfile``` is a text file containing instructions for building your source code. ```Dockerfile```s are crucial inputs for image builds and can facilitate automated, multi-layer image builds based on your unique configurations. 

| Instruction | Description |
| -- | -- |
| ``` FROM <image> ``` | Defines a **base for your image**. |
| ``` RUN <command> ``` | Executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commits the result. RUN also has a shell form for running commands. Use  ``` RUN --mount=type=bind ``` if you need to **add files from the build context to the container temporarily** to execute a RUN instruction. |
| ``` WORKDIR <directory> ``` | **Sets the working directory** for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile. If the WORKDIR **doesn't exist, it will be created** even if it's not used in any subsequent Dockerfile instruction. |
| ``` COPY <src> <dest> ``` | Copies **new files or directories** from \<src> and adds them to the filesystem of the container at the path \<dest>. |
| ``` ADD <src> <dest> ``` | Copies new files, directories or remote file URLs from \<src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path \<dest>. Note: better use ``` COPY ``` to copy files and directories and **only use ``` ADD ``` to access remote file URLS** -do not use a tool such as wget or tar- |
| ``` CMD <command> ``` | Lets you define the default program that is run once you start the container based on this image. **Each Dockerfile only has one CMD, and only the last CMD instance is respected when multiple exist**. |

## Docker Compose

### Docker Compose commands

| Command | Action |
| -- | -- |
| ```docker compose up [-d]``` | Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service. Use ```-d``` for detached mode -run containers in the background-. |
| ```docker compose down``` | Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by ```up```. Use ```-v``` to remove named volumes declared in the "volumes" section of the Compose file and anonymous volumes attached to containers. |
| ```docker compose run <service> [<command>]``` | Runs a one-time command against a service. |
| ```docker compose stop``` | Stops your services if you have started them with ```docker compose up -d```. |
| ```docker compose ps``` | Lists containers for a Compose project, with current status and exposed ports. |
| ```docker compose config``` | Renders the actual data model to be applied on the Docker Engine. It merges the Compose files set by -f flags, resolves variables in the Compose file, and expands short-notation into the canonical format. |

### Docker Compose file

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container applications. It is the key to unlocking a streamlined and efficient development and deployment experience.

Compose simplifies the control of your entire application stack, making it easy to manage services, networks, and volumes in a single, comprehensible YAML configuration file. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration file.

The default path for a Compose file is **```compose.yaml```** (preferred) or ```compose.yml``` that is placed in the working directory. Compose also supports ```docker-compose.yaml``` and ```docker-compose.yml``` for backwards compatibility of earlier versions. If both files exist, Compose prefers the canonical ```compose.yaml```.

#### .env file

An ```.env``` file in Docker Compose is a text file used to define environment variables that should be made available to Docker containers when running ```docker compose up```. This file typically contains key-value pairs of environment variables -values can be optionally single/double quoted-, and it allows you to centralize and manage configuration in one place. The ```.env``` file is useful if you have multiple environment variables you need to store.  

The ```.env``` file is the default method for setting environment variables in your containers. The ```.env``` file should be placed at the root of the project directory next to your ```compose.yaml``` file. In the ```compose.yaml``` use ```${<NAME>}``` where you want to interpoate a variable -```<NAME>``` is he key of the pair, braces are optional-.

**Be cautious about including sensitive data in environment variables**. Consider using [Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/use-secrets/) for managing sensitive information.


#### Networking in Compose

By default Compose sets up a single network for your app. Each container for a service joins the default network and is both reachable by other containers on that network, and discoverable by the service's name.  
Your app's network is given a name based on the ```project_name``` -the network will be called ```<project_name>.default```, which is based on the name of the directory it lives in.  

```
<service>:
	networks:
		- <network_name>
	ports:
		- "<host_port>:<container_port>"

networks:
	[<network_name>:
		[[driver: <driver_name>]
		[driver_opts:
			[<opt1>: "<define_opt1>"]*]]]
```

It is important to note the distinction between ```host_port``` and ```container_port```. Networked service-to-service communication uses the ```container_port```. When ```host_port``` is defined, the service is accessible outside the swarm as well.

**Reference containers by name**, not IP, whenever possible. Otherwise youâ€™ll need to constantly update the IP address you use.  

#### Compose for production

Consider defining an additional Compose file, for example ```production.yml```, which specifies production-appropriate configuration. This configuration file only needs to include the changes you want to make from the original Compose file. The additional Compose file is then applied over the original ```compose.yml``` to create a new configuration.  

Once you have a second configuration file, you can use it with the -f option:

```
docker compose -f compose.yml -f production.yml up -d
```

#### Deploying changes
When you make changes to your app code, remember to rebuild your image and recreate your app's containers:

```
docker compose build <modified_container_name>
docker compose up --no-deps -d <modified_container_name>
```
This first command rebuilds the image for ```<modified_container_name>``` and then stops, destroys, and recreates just the ```<modified_container_name>``` service. The --no-deps flag prevents Compose from also recreating any services which ```<modified_container_name>``` depends on.

#### Services top-level elements

A service is an abstract definition of a computing resource within an application which can be scaled or replaced independently from other components. Services are backed by a set of containers, run by the platform according to replication requirements and placement constraints. As services are backed by containers, they are defined by a Docker image and set of runtime arguments. All containers within a service are identically created with these arguments.  

A Compose file must declare a ```services``` top-level element as a map whose keys are string representations of service names, and whose values are service definitions. A service definition contains the configuration that is applied to each service container.  

Each service may also include a ```build``` section, which defines how to create the Docker image for the service. Compose supports building docker images using this service definition. If not used, the build section is ignored and the Compose file is still considered valid.  

Each service defines runtime constraints and requirements to run its containers. The ```deploy``` section groups these constraints and allows the platform to adjust the deployment strategy to best match containers' needs with available resources. If not implemented the ```deploy``` section is ignored and the Compose file is still considered valid.
