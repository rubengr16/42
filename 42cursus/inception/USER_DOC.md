## Used services

### Mariadb

[MariaDB Server](https://mariadb.org/about/) is one of the 
most popular database servers in the world. It turns data
into structured information -relational DB- in a wide array
of applications, ranging from banking to websites.

MariaDB will store all the information generated by the wordpress
application.

This service will have a volume mapped at
`/home/\<login\>/data/mariadb` -in this case is `rgallego`- and exposes
internally the port 3306.

### Wordpress

[Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/documentation/) is a CMS -Content Management
System- built on PHP and MySQL -MariaDB in this project-, also runs using PHP-FPM
-FastCGI Process Manager-.

Here another volume is used `/home/\<login\>/data/html` to store all the wordpress
files and share them with the NGINX container.

Finally the 9000 is exposed internally to receive the CGI requests redirected from
NGINX.

### NGINX

[NGINX](https://nginx.org/)  is an HTTP web server, reverse proxy, content cache,
load balancer, TCP/UDP proxy server, and mail proxy server. 

It receives requests through the port 443 -SSL configured with the keys
generated- and returns the information obtained from PHP and wordpress.

## Start and stop the project
The project can be run and used with the following commands:

| command | purpose | translation |
| - | - | - |
| `make` / `make all` / `make up` | Raise the containers, they need to be build previously | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml up -d` |
| `make up detachless` | Same as the previous command but whithout the detachless mode, all logs will be seen in the console | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml up` |
| `make down` | Turns down all containers and networks | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml down` |
| `make exec` | Executes a interactive `sh` console in the given service -`S=<service>` or `SERVICE=<service>`, defaults to mariadb- | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml exec -it <service> sh` |
| `make ps` | See the state of running the services. With `PS_A=1` shows also the state of finished containers. | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml ps` |
| `make fclean` | Does `clean` | - |
| `make logs` | Shows the docker logs of the services specified by `S` or `SERVICE` -defaults to mariadb- and with the `F` or `LOGFILE` variable shows the logs of the service inside the container | `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml logs <service>` / `docker compose -f srcs/docker-compose.yml exec <service> cat <logfile>` |
| `make fclean` | Does `build` and deletes the volumes of mariadb and wordpress | - |
| `make fclean` | Does `clean` | - |
| `make re` | Does `fclean`, `build` and `all` | - |

## `.env` files and credentials
For the correct execution of the project, there are some files needed
under `srcs/` folder which are `.env` and secrets files:

### `.env`

Needs to configure the following environment variables:

| variable | meaning |
| - | - |
|`DB_NAME=<env_variable_value>` | Name of the DB used by wordpress |
|`DB_USER=<env_variable_value>` | User used by wordpress |
|`DOMAIN=<env_variable_value>` | Domain of the wordpress site, the login aka `rgallego.42.fr` in this case |
|`WP_DEBUG=<env_variable_value>` | \[Optional\] Variable to set debugging in wordpress |
|`WP_DEBUG_LOG=<env_variable_value>` | \[Optional\] Variable to set debugging in wordpress |
|`WP_TITLE=<env_variable_value>` | Title shown in the tab of the wordpress site |
|`WP_ADMIN=<env_variable_value>` | Wordpress admin's username |
|`WP_ADMIN_EMAIL=<env_variable_value>` | Wordpress admin's email|
|`WP_USER=<env_variable_value>` | Wordpress user's username |
|`WP_USER_EMAIL=<env_variable_value>` | Wordpress user's email |

### `secrets/` folder

The next files need to be created with their values:
- db_root_password.txt
- db_user_password.txt
- wp_admin_password.txt
- wp_user_password.txt
- wp_auth_key.txt
- wp_auth_salt.txt
- wp_logged_in_key.txt
- wp_logged_in_salt.txt
- wp_nonce_key.txt
- wp_nonce_salt.txt
- wp_secure_auth_key.txt
- wp_secure_auth_salt.txt

## Website and administration panel

The website can be accessed in [https://rgallego.42.fr](https://rgallego.42.fr), this will be
the same as accessing to the `wp-login.php`. Here it will be possible to login with the
credentials of the admin or normal user previously set on the `.env` file or `secrets/` folder.

Obviously, the normal user has a view of an `author` as called in
wordpress and admin user to access the administration view and panel -`wp-admin`-.

## Services diagnosis

For services diagnosis some of the commands and their variables
stated in [Start and stop the project](#start-and-stop-the-project)
such as:
- `make ps`: see the state of the services
- `make logs`: see the container's and application's logs
- `make exec`: interact directly with the containers, services and their configuration files
